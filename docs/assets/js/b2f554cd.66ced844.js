We tag versions so feel free to checkout that tag and compile.\\n\\nSo it was difficult for aqua to support gox.\\n\\nBut from v1.7.0, aqua has introduced a new package type named `go` to support these tools.\\nWhen packages of the type `go` are installed, GitHub Repository archives (tarball) are downloaded and unarchived, and binaries are built by `go build` command.\\nTo run `go build`, **Go is required**. In my understanding, we can run `go build` safely because any external malicious commands aren\'t run in `go build`.\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nThe usage of `go` type packages are exactly the same as other type packages.\\n\\ne.g.\\n\\n```yaml\\n$ aqua init\\n$ aqua g -i mitchellh/gox\\n$ cat aqua.yaml\\n---\\n# aqua - Declarative CLI Version Manager\\n# https://aquaproj.github.io/\\nregistries:\\n- type: standard\\n  ref: v2.19.0 # renovate: depName=aquaproj/aqua-registry\\npackages:\\n- name: mitchellh/gox@v1.0.1\\n\\n$ aqua i\\nINFO[0000] create a symbolic link                        aqua_version=1.9.0 env=darwin/arm64 link_file=/Users/shunsukesuzuki/.local/share/aquaproj-aqua/bin/gox new=aqua-proxy package_name=mitchellh/gox package_version=v1.0.1 program=aqua registry=standard registry_ref=v2.19.0\\nINFO[0000] download and unarchive the package            aqua_version=1.9.0 env=darwin/arm64 package_name=mitchellh/gox package_version=v1.0.1 program=aqua registry=standard registry_ref=v2.19.0\\nINFO[0000] building Go tool                              aqua_version=1.9.0 env=darwin/arm64 exe_path=/Users/shunsukesuzuki/.local/share/aquaproj-aqua/pkgs/go/github.com/mitchellh/gox/v1.0.1/bin/gox file_name=gox go_build_dir=/Users/shunsukesuzuki/.local/share/aquaproj-aqua/pkgs/go/github.com/mitchellh/gox/v1.0.1/src/gox-1.0.1 go_src=. package_name=mitchellh/gox package_version=v1.0.1 program=aqua registry=standard registry_ref=v2.19.0\\ngo: downloading github.com/hashicorp/go-version v1.0.0\\ngo: downloading github.com/mitchellh/iochan v1.0.0\\n```\\n\\nPlease see the log of `aqua i`. You can confirm that gox is built.\\n\\n## Benefit\\n\\n* Support installing tools that no binary is provided\\n* Pin the tool version\\n* Change the tool version per project\\n* Update tools by Renovate\\n\\n## Specify a commit sha instead of a tag\\n\\nSome tools aren\'t tagged properly, or there is too much difference between the latest tag and the latest default branch.\\nIn that case, you can also specify a commit sha as a version instead of a tag.\\n\\ne.g. aqua.yaml\\n\\n```yaml\\nregistries:\\n- type: standard\\n  ref: v2.19.0\\npackages:\\n- name: mitchellh/gox\\n  version: 8c3b2b9e647dc52457d6ee7b5adcf97e2bafe131 # Specify commit sha\\n```\\n\\n## Can we specify `latest` like `go install`?\\n\\nAs you know, `go install` supports specifying `latest`.\\n\\ne.g.\\n\\n```console\\n$ go install github.com/google/wire/cmd/wire@latest\\n```\\n\\nOn the other hand, aqua doesn\'t support specifying `latest` because aqua is **CLI Version Manager**.\\nYou must specify the version strictly.\\n\\n## Example tools supported by package type `go`\\n\\nIn the [release of aqua-registry v2.19.0](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua-registry/releases/tag/v2.19.0), aqua-registry has supported the following go type packages.\\n\\n* [golang/tools/gopls](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls): Go language server\\n* [google/wire](https://github.com/google/wire): Compile-time Dependency Injection for Go\\n* [katbyte/terrafmt](https://github.com/katbyte/terrafmt): Format terraform blocks embedded in files\\n* [mitchellh/gox](https://github.com/mitchellh/gox): A dead simple, no frills Go cross compile tool\\n* [anqiansong/github-compare](https://github.com/anqiansong/github-compare): A Command-line statistics tool to compare the GitHub repositories\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn this post, I\'ve described the feature introduced from aqua [v1.7.0](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua/releases/tag/v1.7.0).\\nFrom v1.7.0, aqua supports building tools with Go when they are installed.\\nThis feature is powerful and changes the management of Go tools that don\'t provide binaries.\\n\\n## Reference\\n\\n* https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua/releases/tag/v1.7.0\\n* https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua-registry/releases/tag/v2.19.0\\n* https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua-registry/pull/3713\\n* https://aquaproj.github.io/docs/registry-config#go-package\\n* https://zenn.dev/shunsuke_suzuki/scraps/7e8ac509fe39bd (Japanese)"},{"id":"/2021/12/23/why-i-use-aqua","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/12/23/why-i-use-aqua","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-23-why-i-use-aqua.md","title":"Why I use aqua","description":"Original Post//dev.to/suzukishunsuke/why-i-use-aqua-230","date":"2021-12-23T00:32:46.000Z","formattedDate":"December 23, 2021","tags":[],"readingTime":1.19,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Shunsuke Suzuki","title":"SRE / OSS Contributor / Tool Maker / Go / Terraform","url":"https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke","imageURL":"https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke.png","key":"suzuki-shunsuke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Why I use aqua","date":"2021-12-23T00:32:46.000Z","authors":["suzuki-shunsuke"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Support building tools with Go","permalink":"/blog/2022/05/30/support-building-go-tools"},"nextItem":{"title":"Manage CLI tool version with aqua","permalink":"/blog/2021/12/04/aqua-overview"}},"content":"<head>\\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://dev.to/suzukishunsuke/why-i-use-aqua-230\\" />\\n</head>\\n\\nOriginal Post: https://dev.to/suzukishunsuke/why-i-use-aqua-230\\n\\nIn this post, I describe why I use aqua.\\n\\n## Why I use\xa0aqua\\n\\n* Align tool versions in team and CI\\n  * Solve the problem due to the difference of tool versions\\n* Manage tools and their versions for projects as code declaratively, and provide an unified way to install tools\\n  * aqua supports changing tool versions per project\\n* Stop developing shell scripts and GitHub Actions to install tools per tool and per project\\n* Update tools with Renovate easily\\n* Install tools hosted in private repositories\\n\\n## Why not\xa0asdf?\\n\\nasdf is used for the similar purpose, but I use aqua.

Unlike other package managers such as Homebrew, aqua manages CLI tools with declarative YAML Configuration files.\\n\\n## Pin Tool Version\\n\\naqua forces to pin tool version, which solves the problem due to the difference of tool version.\\n\\n## Auto update with Renovate\\n\\nWith Renovate Preset Config for aqua, you can update tools continuously with Renovate.\\n\\n## Lazy Install\\n\\nWhen the tool is invoked, aqua installs the tool automatically. This feature ensures the executed tool version is exactly same as the configuration.\\n\\n## Change tool version easily\\n\\nBy editing the tool version in the configuration file, you can easily change the tool version. You can try a new version or downgrade the tool easily.\\n\\n## Change tool version per configuration\\n\\nYou can manage tool version per configuration file. You can install multiple versions in the same machine and switch them per project.\\n\\n## Manage your tools as dotfiles\\n\\nBy managing your aqua configuration file in Git repository such as your dotfiles, you can manage your tools as code. You can set up your new laptop and use the same tool version in your multiple laptops easily.\\n\\n## Manage tools for your team and organization\\n\\naqua supports not only personal use but also team and organization use. By managing aqua configuration for your team and organization in Git Repository, you can manage tools for your team and organization as code. New joiners can set up their laptops quickly and you can distribute tools easily.\\n\\n## Manage tools for a repository\\n\\nBy adding aqua configuration file to a repository, you can manage tools for the repository with aqua. aqua manages tool versions declaratively, so you always only have to execute the same command. So new contributors can set up quickly and you can update tools easily. You don\u2019t have to maintain the document about required tools and you don\u2019t have to investigate how to install them.\\n\\n## Install tools managed in the private GitHub Repositories\\n\\naqua supports installing tools from the private GitHub Repositories. It\u2019s useful to distribute your organization\u2019s private tools.\\n\\n## Use aqua in CI\\n\\nThere are GitHub Actions and CircleCI Orb for aqua, so you can install tools with aqua easily in CI too. You can use the same version in both local development and CI.\\n\\nBy the way, many GitHub Actions install the tool automatically before executing it. It\u2019s very easy to use, but there are some problems.\\n\\n* Some GitHub Actions don\u2019t force to pin tool versions, which may cause the problem due to the difference of tool version\\n* When you specify tool version in inputs, you have to update it continuously but it\u2019s not easy\\n* You can\u2019t install tools in your laptop for local development with GitHub Actions. You have to install tools by the other way\\n* It\u2019s difficult to unify tool versions in local development and CI\\n\\naqua solves the above problems.\\n\\n* aqua forces to pin tool versions\\n* With Renovate Preset Config for aqua, you can update tools easily with Renovate\\n* aqua supports both local development and CI\\n* You can use the same configuration in both local development and CI, so you can unify tool versions easily\\n\\n## Registry\\n\\nRegistry is aqua\u2019s mechanism to manage the list of installable tools and how to install them. Registry is a simple YAML. You can write Registry in aqua configuration, or you can read it from other local files and GitHub Repositories. You can manage private Registry in private GitHub Repository.\\n\\nWe maintain the Standard Registry and you can install tools in the Registry easily without writing Registry by your self.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn this post, I introduced the CLI tool aqua, which manages CLI tool version with YAML.

Write the following `aqua.yaml`.\\n\\n```yaml\\nregistries:\\n- type: standard\\n  ref: v2.19.0 # renovate: depName=aquaproj/aqua-registry\\npackages:\\n- name: stedolan/jq\\n  version: jq-1.5\\n```\\n\\nAnd run `aqua i -l`.\\n\\n```console\\n$ aqua i -l\\n```\\n\\nThe option `-l` is important. By this option, the symbolic links are created in `~/.aqua/bin` but the downloading tools is skipped.\\nThis is the feature named `Lazy Install`.\\n\\nTools are installed in `~/.local/share/aquaproj-aqua`. Let\'s add `~/.local/share/aquaproj-aqua/bin` to the environment variable `PATH`.\\n\\n```console\\n$ export PATH=$HOME/.local/share/aquaproj-aqua/bin:$PATH\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s check if jq installed correctly.\\n\\n```console\\n$ jq --version\\nINFO[0000] download and unarchive the package            package_name=jq package_version=jq-1.5 program=aqua registry=standard\\njq-1.5\\n```\\n\\nThe output `INFO[0000] download and unarchive the package            package_name=jq package_version=jq-1.5 program=aqua registry=standard` indicates that jq is installed automatically before jq is executed.\\n\\naqua searches the configuration file `[.]aqua.y[a]ml` from the current directory to the root directory.\\n\\n```console\\n$ cd foo\\n$ jq --version\\njq-1.5\\n\\n$ cd ../..\\n$ jq --version\\nFATA[0000] aqua failed                                   error=\\"command is not found\\" exe_name=jq program=aqua\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s update jq from 1.5 to 1.6.\\n\\n```yaml\\npackages:\\n- name: stedolan/jq\\n  version: jq-1.6\\n```\\n\\nAnd run `jq --version`.\\nBefore jq is executed, jq is installed automatically.\\n\\n```console\\n$ jq --version\\nINFO[0000] download and unarchive the package            package_name=jq package_version=jq-1.6 program=aqua registry=standard\\njq-1.6\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s downgrade jq from 1.6 to 1.5.\\n\\n```yaml\\npackages:\\n- name: stedolan/jq\\n  version: jq-1.5\\n```\\n\\n```console\\n$ jq --version\\njq-1.5\\n```\\n\\nThe version of tool is changed seamlessly.\\nYou don\'t have to execute `aqua`.\\n\\nBy adding `aqua.yaml` in each Git repositories, you can manage tools for each repositories.\\nDevelopers can use the same version, which prevents the problem due to the difference of tool versions.\\naqua supports both MacOS and Linux, so even if you are working on MacOS and CI is run on Linux, you can manage tools with the same aqua.yaml.\\n\\naqua installs tools in `~/.local/share/aquaproj-aqua` and shares tools across multiple `aqua.yaml`, so the same version of the same tool is installed only at once.\\nIt saves time and disk usage.\\n\\naqua supports the Global configuration.\\nThis is useful to install tools in your laptop regardless the specific project.\\nLike `dotfiles`, it is good to manage the Global Configuration with Git and share it with your multiple laptops.\\n\\n## Registry\\n\\naqua supports the Sharable Configuration mechanism named `Registry`.\\n\\nYou can install jq with the simple configuration.\\n\\n```yaml\\nregistries:\\n- type: standard\\n  ref: v2.19.0\\n\\npackages:\\n- name: stedolan/jq\\n  version: jq-1.5\\n```\\n\\nIn the above configuration, the [Standard Registry](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua-registry) is being used.\\nThe Standard Registry is the Registry maintained by aqua\'s maintainers.\\n\\nPlease see the configuration.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/aquaproj/aqua-registry/blob/v2.19.0/pkgs/stedolan/jq/registry.yaml\\n\\n```yaml\\npackages:\\n  -
