# Install private packages

Of course, [Standard Registry](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua-registry) doesn't include private packages, which are hosted in private GitHub Repositories.
But you can install private packages by creating your own `local` Registry or `github_content` Registry.

About how to create a Registry, please see [Use local Registry](/docs/develop-registry/add-registry#use-local-registry) and [Create a GitHub Repository for Registry](/docs/develop-registry/add-registry#create-a-github-repository-for-registry).
